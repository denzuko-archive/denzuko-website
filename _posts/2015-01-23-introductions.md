Who and what is a Dwight Spencer. Well that is both hard and easy to define depending on which prospective one wishes to evaluate.

  
On one hand there is the geeky hacker that is always tinkering/inventing, loves shadow run, techno, urban adventuring and street racing. My friends know this facet very well.  
  
On another hand there is the serious professional who's always out to get things done for the client. Many business contacts know this side of Dwight Spencer.  
  
On the final hand. Yes three hands because any more than that and this Dwight Spencer would start to look like some ancient Hindi deity, there is the funnyquick witted and strongly devoted family man.  
  
In either case this blog will document my passions and ideas so one would see a portion of each.
